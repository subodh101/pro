Below are some common gcloud commands and their usage: Authentication and Configuration: gcloud auth login: Initiates the login process to authenticate with your Google Cloud account. gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID: Sets the default GCP project to be used. gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE: Sets the default compute zone. gcloud config set compute/region REGION: Sets the default compute region. gcloud auth application-default login: Authorizes application-default credentials for your local environment. Compute Engine: gcloud compute instances create INSTANCE_NAME: Creates a new Compute Engine virtual machine instance. gcloud compute instances list: Lists all Compute Engine instances in your project. gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE_NAME: SSH into a Compute Engine instance. gcloud compute firewall-rules create RULE_NAME --allow=PORT: Creates a firewall rule to allow traffic to a specific port. Storage (Google Cloud Storage): gcloud storage buckets create BUCKET_NAME: Creates a new Cloud Storage bucket. gcloud storage buckets list: Lists all Cloud Storage buckets in your project. gcloud storage cp LOCAL_FILE gs://BUCKET_NAME/REMOTE_DIRECTORY: Copies a local file to a Cloud Storage bucket. gcloud storage ls gs://BUCKET_NAME: Lists objects in a Cloud Storage bucket. BigQuery: gcloud bigquery datasets create DATASET_NAME: Creates a new BigQuery dataset. gcloud bigquery datasets list: Lists all BigQuery datasets in your project. bq query --nouse_legacy_sql 'SQL_QUERY': Runs a BigQuery SQL query from the command line. App Engine: gcloud app create: Creates a new App Engine application. gcloud app deploy: Deploys the current directory as an App Engine application. gcloud app versions list: Lists all deployed versions of an App Engine application. Kubernetes Engine (GKE): gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME: Creates a new GKE cluster. gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME: Configures kubectl to use the GKE cluster. kubectl get pods: Lists Kubernetes pods in the current cluster. IAM and Permissions: gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member=USER_OR_GROUP --role=ROLE: Grants IAM permissions to a user or group on a project. Cloud Functions: gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME --runtime RUNTIME --trigger-http: Deploys a Cloud Function. gcloud functions list: Lists all Cloud Functions in your project. Note These are just a few examples of the many gcloud commands available for managing different Google Cloud services. You can get detailed help for any command by appending --help to it (e.g., gcloud compute instances create --help).
